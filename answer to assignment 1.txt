Problem 0
1. See "105022469_problem0.cpp".
2. See the running result of "105022469_problem0.exe".
3. See the running result of "105022469_problem0.exe".
4. Yes. As the number of trials increases, the magnitude (absolute value) of the differences between the number of times a given side occurs and one-sixth of the number of trials increases.
5. Yes. As I increase the number of trials, the ratio of the number of times each side occurs to the total number of trials approaches closer to 1/6.

Problem 1
1. Theoretical mean = (S+1)/2
   Theoretical variance = (S^2-1)/12
   Theoretical standard deviation = sqrt((S^2-1)/12)
2. See "105022469_problem1.cpp".
3. See the running result of "105022469_problem1.exe". The results for the mean, variance, and standard deviation are consistent with my predictions.
4. See the running result of "105022469_problem1.exe". In my result it's roughly 1000 times.
